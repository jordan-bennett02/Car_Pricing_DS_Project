# Car_Pricing_DS_Project
Files related to a data science project on vehicle pricing.

In this project we examine a dataset examining the sales prices of used cars. Our goal to explore various regression techniques to estimate the price of the used cars. In addition, we will explore clustering and convex averages to compare regression models applied to the entire datasets vs. localized regression. More will be explained in the methodology section below.

# Software

This project will primarily utilize the Python language, along with some common additional libraries such as numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn. We will also utilize the UMAP libary for visualization on clusters.
